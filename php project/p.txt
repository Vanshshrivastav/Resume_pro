i have this info for my college minor project and i dont know about admin site. so guide me on that too and create a prompt to give database.build to create proper database tables query. the "*" fields are importent. also you mention that which field is nullable, non-nullable, primary key and all the importent things, and also mention to connect tables from each other in prompt. and can you tell me what should i add this prompt to make it more accutate?
